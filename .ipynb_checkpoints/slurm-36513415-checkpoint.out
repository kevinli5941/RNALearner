/home/kli3/.conda/envs/scbert/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/distributed/launch.py:180: FutureWarning: The module torch.distributed.launch is deprecated
and will be removed in future. Use torchrun.
Note that --use_env is set by default in torchrun.
If your script expects `--local_rank` argument to be set, please
change it to read from `os.environ['LOCAL_RANK']` instead. See 
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#launch-utility for 
further instructions

The boolean parameter 'some' has been replaced with a string parameter 'mode'.
